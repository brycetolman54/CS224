# Machine Code

- Why do we use binary?
    - It is really easy to make in hardware (on and off)
- We use bits (on or off) and logic gates (OR, AND, etc.) to implement the stuff
- Then, we found transistors. That allowed us to make fast switches (before it was crap) that worked well and were solid.
